== Accessing your Lab Instance

* You need Vagrant (2.0.1+) + VirtualBox (5.1.30+)
* Run the following commands to start the Lab VM locally:
+
[source,bash]
----
# Getting the VM template (1 time only)
vagrant box add jenkins-lab-demo http://bit.ly/2BxqFPT
# Initialize the environment (1 time only)
mkdir ~/jenkins-lab-demo && cd ~/jenkins-lab-demo
vagrant init -m -f jenkins-lab-demo
# Start the lab
vagrant up
----

* Open the URL link:http://[YOUR_INSTANCE_DNS]:10000
** Welcome to the *Lab Home Page*
* Click the link *Workshop Slides*
** Browse to this current slide

== Accessing Source Code

* Access the *Gitea git server*:
** link:{gitserver-url}[{gitserver-url},window=_blank]
** *Log in*  as the user *`butler`* (password is the same)
* Access the source code:
** Once authenticated, click on *Explore* (on top)
** Click on *{admin-user}/{demoapp-repo-name}*
*** Direct link: link:{demoapp-repo-web-url}[]

== Accessing Jenkins

* Access your Jenkins instance:
** link:{jenkins-url}[{jenkins-url},window=_blank]
** *Log in*  as the user *`butler`* (password is the same)
** This is the "Jenkins Classic GUI"

== Blue Ocean

* Switch to Blue Ocean:
** link:{jenkins-url}/blue[Direct link to Blue Ocean GUI,window=_blank]
** _Or_ click on the item "Open Blue Ocean", on the left menu

== Exercise: Create First Project

* Create a new Pipeline, with the following properties:
** Stored in *Git*
** Get the *SSH* URL from the _git server_
** Configure Jenkins access to the source code:
*** In Gitea, click the top-right user drop down
*** Browse to SSH/GPG Keys
*** Add a new key, by copy and pasting from Jenkins

== Exercise - Your First Pipeline

* Click the button *Create a Pipeline*
* Use the *Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor* and *Gitea git server*
* Create a Pipeline that have 3 stages: *Build*, *Test* and *Deploy*
* Each stage has 1 step that prints a message
** "Building..." for *Build*, "Testing..." for *Test* ...
* Save, add a commit message and see the build kicking off

== Solution - Your first pipeline

== Exercise - Run tasks with Pipeline

* Using the *Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor*:
** Edit the current Pipeline's 3 stages to run scripts
** Scripts are stored in the `./scripts` folder (in SCM)
** Use the step *Shell Script* (keyword `sh`)
** Remove the `echo` steps
* Save, add a commit message and see the build kicking off

== Solution - Run tasks with Pipeline

== Exercise - Archives and Tests

* Using the *Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor*:
** Edit the current Pipeline
** *Build* stage should archive all `{asterisk}.jar` files
*** Found in the directory `target`. TIP for pattern: `{asterisk}.jar`
** *Test* stage should publish the `junit` test reports
*** Found in `target`. TIP for recursive pattern: `{asterisk}{asterisk}/{asterisk}.xml`
* Save, add a commit message and see the build kicking off
* Build should be *UNSTABLE*
